    <h1>Professional Reflections</h1>

    <h2>Reflection on Principles of Sustainability to Create Viable Systems</h2>
    <p>During my internship at SoftWire Systems, I was involved in tasks such as debugging firmware issues and troubleshooting complex hardware systems. Initially, I felt enthusiastic about contributing to projects with sustainable impacts on workflow efficiency. However, this enthusiasm was challenged when I encountered a significant issue due to poor documentation on existing firmware tasks. The lack of detailed documentation made it difficult to continue previous work effectively.</p>
    <p>Previously, I viewed sustainability mostly in environmental terms, such as energy conservation or waste reduction. This experience expanded my perspective, making me realize sustainability also encompasses knowledge management and documentation practices. I recognized how failing to document technical processes resulted in wasted resources, as substantial time was spent relearning information that could have been easily preserved.</p>
    <p>The primary difficulty was inadequate continuity and documentation from previous engineers, causing delays in my workflow. This contradicted core sustainable engineering principles highlighted by Dowling et al. (2016), particularly resource conservation and stakeholder consultation. Effective documentation is crucial not only for environmental sustainability but also for operational efficiency, ensuring that knowledge is transferred smoothly between engineers.</p>
    <p>Reflecting on this incident, I've recognized the importance of thorough and clear documentation, especially in complex technical environments. Going forward, I will ensure meticulous documentation of my workâ€”detailing decisions, troubleshooting steps, and outcomesâ€”to support future project sustainability and improve team efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Reflection on Professional Practice within Intercultural and Global Contexts</h2>
    <p>At SoftWire Systems, I collaborated with colleagues from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of technical expertise. Initially, this posed challenges in clearly communicating ideas, particularly during weekly team meetings. Early on, I experienced uncertainty when navigating discussions that involved colleagues with different communication styles and cultural perspectives.</p>
    <p>Previously, my concept of professionalism centred on technical competence and timely completion of tasks. However, working closely with colleagues like Alex, who provided mentorship and encouraged active participation in discussions, broadened my understanding. I came to realize professionalism also entails effective intercultural communication, adaptability, and proactive engagement in a globalized engineering environment.</p>
    <p>A particular difficulty arose from differing expectations regarding communication. Some team members favoured direct, concise interaction, while others preferred comprehensive and indirect discussions. This occasionally led to misunderstandings or misalignment on project tasks, especially when dealing with persistent issue.</p>
    <p>Seeking guidance from colleagues and observing experienced team members helped me understand the importance of adaptability in professional communication. Engineering Australia's competency standards emphasize clear communication and mutual understanding, and applying this principle allowed me to actively engage in meetings and contribute meaningfully despite initial discomfort.</p>
    <p>This internship experience underscored that professional practice involves not just technical expertise but also cultural sensitivity and communication agility. Moving forward, I will prioritize developing stronger intercultural communication skills, actively fostering inclusive dialogue, and maintaining clarity in technical collaboration, ensuring effectiveness in diverse professional contexts.</p>
