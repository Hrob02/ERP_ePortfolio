      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering runs in my blood—my grandfather, great-grandfather, and cousin all pursued careers in engineering, and from a young age, I knew I wanted to create and innovate. As a child, I stayed up past my bedtime watching documentaries about the cosmos with my dad, captivated by the mysteries of the universe. I once declared that I wanted to be an inventor, only to later realize that engineering is the modern-day equivalent. My grandfather, a born problem- solver, fueled this passion by sharing stories of his own curiosity, like the time he rode his bike into an airport, convinced the staff he was a pilot’s son, and was allowed to sit in the cockpit of a plane. His adventurous spirit and hands -on approach to understanding the world deeply influenced the way I see engineering—as a gateway to solving problems and pushing boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as a Mechatronic Engineering and Applied Physics student at UTS, I am particularly drawn to sustainable innovation, AI, and automation. I am inspired by Solarpunk aesthetics—a vision of a world where technology and nature exist in harmony—and I hope to contribute to projects that design a future I am excited to live in. My work at SoftWire Systems on plasma-cleaning technology for aerospace and medical applications, as well as my C++ and ROS2-based autonomous navigation project, has allowed me to develop skills in firmware, software, and automation while working on real-world engineering challenges. Beyond technical work, my deep curiosity about psychology, human interaction, and systems thinking informs my approach to problem-solving. I believe the best engineering solutions don’t just meet technical requirements but also consider the needs and experiences of the people they impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the short term, I aim to secure a graduate role with a company that inspires and challenges me, particularly in software, firmware, and automation engineering. Long term, I see myself leading teams, influencing company trajectories, and driving sustainable innovation through project management and consulting. I am a naturally curious learner who thrives on variety, constantly looking for opportunities to expand my skills and challenge conventional thinking.
