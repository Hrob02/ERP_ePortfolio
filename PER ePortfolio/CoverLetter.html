      <p><strong>Re: Graduate Mechatronic Engineer Application</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>

    <p>I am excited to apply for the Graduate Mechatronic Engineer role at Industrus Engineering. As a final-year Mechatronic Engineering and Applied Physics student at the University of Technology Sydney, I am passionate about innovative and sustainable engineering solutions and eager to grow within a team that drives real-world impact.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Commitment to ethical conduct and the highest standards of professional accountability (3.1)</strong><br>
    During my time on the UTS Rover Science Team, we were tasked with designing a modular casing for sensitive science units used in Mars rover simulations. I was responsible for ensuring our designs met safety and documentation standards. I took the initiative to implement a version control system and created transparent documentation of all design changes. As a result, our team maintained clarity throughout the project lifecycle, which allowed the casing to move smoothly into prototype testing.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Effective communication with engineers and multidisciplinary stakeholders (3.2)</strong><br>
    While working as a personal assistant for a satellite technology company, I regularly coordinated between engineering teams and international clients. One situation required me to translate complex project timelines into digestible updates for stakeholders unfamiliar with technical terminology. I created weekly summary reports that improved cross-team collaboration and ensured alignment on milestones.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Ability to engage with a creative, innovative, and proactive environment (3.3)</strong><br>
    For a university project in “Programming for Mechatronic Systems,” my team developed a navigation simulation involving an Audi and a drone using ROS2 and C++. My task was to integrate odometry feedback to update the drone’s course in real-time. I proposed using a feedback control algorithm not covered in class, which led to smooth obstacle avoidance and exceeded project goals.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Ability to use and manage information (3.4)</strong><br>
    While developing a PCB for a step-counting device using Altium, I needed to process data from an accelerometer. I analyzed the raw sensor output in MATLAB and adjusted microcontroller code to filter out noise. I documented each iteration in a shared log, and the resulting prototype reliably detected step patterns.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Ability to manage performance in a professional environment (3.5)</strong><br>
    During a busy semester, I balanced engineering studies with two part-time jobs. I created a structured weekly plan to manage assignments, shifts, and lab work. Despite the demanding schedule, I met all deadlines and performed well academically, improving my time management under pressure.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Ability to work as part of a team and to show leadership when required (3.6)</strong><br>
    In a robotics project, one team member withdrew mid-semester. I stepped up to coordinate the remaining workload and supported others in learning tools like Git. We completed the project on time and received a distinction, with our strong teamwork noted by the lecturer.</p>

    <p>I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring this experience and mindset to Industrus Engineering. Your work on future-focused, sustainable projects aligns with my values. Thank you for considering my application—I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.</p>
